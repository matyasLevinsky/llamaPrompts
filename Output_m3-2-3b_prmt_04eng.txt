>>> You are a qualitative sociologist who codes media texts about alcohol.
...
... You are interested in arguments and actors through which alcohol can cause social, economic, and health harms. You are familiar with framing theory (Entmann, 1993 and Reese, 2007) and its application to
...  media coverage about alcohol (Patterson & Hilton, 2014 and Hansen & Gunter, 2006).
...
... First, read the article thoroughly, then conduct coding according to the following questions.
...
... Coding instructions:
...
... For each theme, you will be making four (4) assesments:
...
... A. Does the theme occur in the article you have read?
... B. If it has occured, on a scale from 0 to 4 where would you rank it? Here each question will provide its own scale for comparison.
... C. A justification of why you belive the theme is present, and how you rated it on the scale.
... D. Your confidence in the assesment, eg. if it is present and on the scale.
...
... These are important questions for the researchers, and we ask you to be focused while answering and follow instructions to the best of your ability. In order to keep answers consistent, you will answer
... by a schema:
...
... 1. First you will write the theme question, and the associated scale, so that we are sure you are answering about the proper theme.
... 2. Then you will write a justification about why you believe the theme IS or IS NOT present in the provided article, and if it IS why you have rated it on the scale as you did. Please keep your answer b
... rief, optimally within 2 sentences.
... 3. Citations from the article that have led to making the assesment in step 2. Please keep your selection brief, at most 2 sentences.
... 4. Boolean choice about the presence of the theme TRUE/FALSE. You have explained this already in step 2. Answers other than TRUE or FALSE cannot be used by the researchers.
... 5. Numeric choice about the scale of present themes, from 0 to 4. You have explained this already in step 2. Answers other than 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 cannot be used by the researcher.
... 6. Your confidence with the assesment you made. This can be written as a factor ranging from "low", "medium" to "high". Other answers cannot be used, please keep to these three categories.
...
... You are asked to fromat your responese for ease of use. Specifically, you will be writing the result for the questions in this JSON format:
...
... {
...   "theme_number": [ # This is from theme "1" till theme "32_d"
...     {
...       "theme_question": "string", # This is to make sure you have read the question properly, and understood the scale.
...       "explanation": "string", # I remind you that this can be at most 2 sentences

...       "theme_occurence": boolean, # Eg. TRUE or FALSE
...       "orientation": number or null (if theme_occurence is FALSE), # Number is in range 0 till 4

...     }
...   ],
...   ... # This is repeated for the topics 1 to 32_d
... }
...
... For themes that are not present in the text, include in the JSON output:
...
... "theme_number": [ # This is from theme "1" till theme "32_d"
...     {
...       "theme_question": "string", # This is to make sure you have read the question properly, and understood the scale.
...       "explanation": "The theme is not present in the text, because...", # Explain why the theme is not present in your opinion. Maximum of two sentences.
...       "citation": [""], # An empty string as citation
...       "theme_occurence": FALSE, # Eg. TRUE or FALSE
...       "orientation": null (if theme_occurenceis FALSE), # null as the theme is not present
